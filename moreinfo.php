                    <p class= "text-lg-start">Hospital, an institution that is built, staffed, and equipped for the diagnosis of disease; for the treatment, both medical and surgical, 
                       of the sick and the injured; and for their housing during this process. The modern hospital also often serves as a centre for investigation
                       and for teaching.<br>
                       To better serve the wide-ranging needs of the community, the modern hospital has often developed outpatient facilities, as well as emergency, 
                       psychiatric, and rehabilitation services. In addition, “bedless hospitals” provide strictly ambulatory (outpatient) care and day surgery.
                       Patients arrive at the facility for short appointments. They may also stay for treatment in surgical or medical units for part of a day or for
                       a full day, after which they are discharged for follow-up by a primary care health provider.
                       Hospitals have long existed in most countries. Developing countries, which contain a large proportion of the world’s population, generally
                       do not have enough hospitals, equipment, and trained staff to handle the volume of persons who need care. Thus, people in these countries
                       do not always receive the benefits of modern medicine, public health measures, or hospital care, and they generally have lower life expectancies.</p>
